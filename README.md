# Iris Dataset Model Documentation

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify the Iris dataset into its three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project leverages Python's scientific computing and machine learning libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.


## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing 150 samples with 4 features each:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The target labels correspond to the three species of Iris flowers.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and descriptive statistics are used to explore the data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Splitting data into train and test sets
   - Standardizing features using Scikit-learn's `StandardScaler`
4. **Model Building**:
   - A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training data.
   - Hyperparameters can be tuned using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Confusion matrix and classification reports provide insights into model performance.
6. **Saving the Model**:
   - The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file using joblib.

## Key Scripts

- `preprocess.py`: Handles data loading, cleaning, and splitting.
- `train_model.py`: Trains the Random Forest Classifier and saves the model.
- `evaluate_model.py`: Loads the saved model and evaluates it on the test set.

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy on the test set and generalizes well to unseen data. Evaluation metrics are documented in the notebook.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more sophisticated hyperparameter tuning techniques.
- Experimenting with other classifiers like SVM or Gradient Boosting.
- Building a simple web interface for model predictions.
